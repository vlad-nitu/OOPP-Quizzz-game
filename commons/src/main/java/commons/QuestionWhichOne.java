/**
 * This is a multiple-choice type of question.
 * This question type asks the user to choose, for a certain activity, the amount of energy he/she thinks the activity consumes
 * out of 3 options.
 * It is similar to 'QuestionHowMuch' type of question, but this comes up in order to help the user to have more
 * chances of choosing a correct answer (as there will be only 3 options available (expressed in kWh), instead of
 * asking the user to input the exact amount of kWh he/she thinks the activity consumes).
 * - activity: the Activity object instance that the user is asked to guess how much energy it consumes.
 * - title: the title of this specific question.
